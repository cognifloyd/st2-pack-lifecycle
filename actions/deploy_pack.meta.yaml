parameters:
  full_repo_name:
    required: true
    type: string
    description: The full github org and repo (like copartit/st2-gitops).
  git_ref:
    required: true
    type: string
    description: A git ref (branch, tag, commit hash) to install. Generally this is master or dev.
  pack:
    required: false
    type: string
    # FIXME: removing "-" is probably not generic
    description: |
      The pack name (like st2gitops). If not defined, this is extracted from full_repo_name
      by taking the repo name (like st2-gitops) and removing "stackstorm-" and "-".
      If that heuristic is not correct, you must pass in the pack name here.
